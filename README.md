# Visual Memory Game
## A simple visual memory game made with pure HTML/CSS/JS.
I wanted to play it so I made one.

Since I'm using fetch to read a local file this won't run by simply opening `index.html` in your browser, you will need to run a local server to play this. If you have already given up completely you can avoid this completely by putting your words directly inside the `wordList` array variable in the JS file.
